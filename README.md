# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-model
A Machine learning model for accurately diagnosing a patient for Parkinson's Disease

# Abstract

In recent years the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) has increased to 10 million worldwide. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system which causes stiffness or slowing of movements and tremor. The purpose of the proposed model is to correctly identify the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual using Machine learning (ML) algorithms. This project is in the domain of data science. This model is made using XGBClassifier which was imported from XGBoost library to build a model that accurately diagnoses a patient for PD . Dataset along with the necessary libraries was imported, perform data analysis and visualization to get  features and labels, scale the features, build an XGBClassifier and evaluate our trained model. To classify PD people from healthy people speech signal processing is done through ML algorithms.

# Dataset

Dataset was obtained from  UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Libraries used

The various python libraries used for the project are : numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, xgboost.
