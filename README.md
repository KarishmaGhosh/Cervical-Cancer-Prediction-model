# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction-Model
A Machine learning model for accurately diagnosing a patient for Cervical Cancer

# Abstract

In 2018 an estimate of 570,000 women got diagnosed with cervical cancer. Around 311,000 women lost their lives to cervical cancer. An early diagnosis of the disease can greatly reduce the number of deaths per annum. It has been reduced by 74% between 1955 to 1992. The purpose of the proposed model is to correctly identify the presence of Cervical cancer in an individual using Machine learning (ML) algorithms. This project is in the domain of data science. This model is made using XGBClassifier which was imported from XGBoost library to build a model that accurately diagnoses a patient for PD . Dataset along with the necessary libraries was imported, perform data analysis and visualization to get  features and labels, scale the features, build an XGBClassifier and evaluate our trained model. To classify PD people from healthy people speech signal processing is done through ML algorithms.

# Dataset

Dataset was obtained from  UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Libraries used

The various python libraries used for the project are : numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, xgboost.
